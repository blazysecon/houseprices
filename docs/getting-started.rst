Getting started
===============

Train and test data sets should be downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and put into data/raw/.
Next the data needs to be prepared. Then the model can be evaluated on the training set or used to produce predictions on the test set. A small set of visualisations can also be created.

All commands are described under “Commands”
